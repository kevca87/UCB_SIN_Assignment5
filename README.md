In order to construct a model to predict the adaptability of a student in online classes. The needed steps were:

## Recognize the kind of problem: <b>Classification</b> 
The waited output is a categorical variable that represents the adaptability level ("Alto", "Moderado", "Bajo") for that reason the model classify each sample in one of that categories.

## Prepare the dataset
In relation to the previously defined categorical variables. Certain input and output variables were transformed to an appropriate representation (One hot encoding).<br>
(This was realized and documented on `data_preparation.ipynb` file)

## Test different hypothesis and neural networks architectures
(This was realized and documented on `neural_network_test.ipynb` file)<br>
Note: To keep an organized code the definition of the Neural Network models and its variations were in `neural_network.py` file.
